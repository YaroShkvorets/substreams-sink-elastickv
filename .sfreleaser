  # You need a specialized goreleaser-cross image that contains WasmEdge (include/lib(s))
  # for each supported platform. For now, we do not publish this image to a public
  # docker registry. So you need to build it manually with
  #
  #   ./devel/docker/push.sh
  #
  # It will build the image locally, then you will be able to release.
